Anisha Iyer (she/her) is a SEED Honors Scholar at UC Berkeley, double majoring in **Computer Science** and **Neurobiology**, with a minor in Clinical Psychology. Her research lies at the intersection of **machine learning, neuroengineering, and molecular neuroscience**, with the goal of advancing our understanding of intelligent systems and developing technologies to address psychiatric and neurological disorders.

She has conducted **deep reinforcement learning research** on chemonavigation at Harvard’s NSF-Simons Center, studied **olfactory memory and learning** at Harvard’s Center for Brain Science, and investigated **immune-driven pain signaling** using electrophysiology, spinal cord microdissection, and Ca²⁺ imaging for her senior thesis in the **Bautista Lab** at Berkeley’s Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute.

At Berkeley, Anisha has led **software and machine learning projects** in brain-computer interfaces, antibody design, biosignal analysis, and traumatic brain injury detection—collaborating with labs at **UCSF**, **Stanford Medicine**, and **Lawrence Berkeley National Lab**. She’s directed student technical teams in **Neurotech@Berkeley**, **ML@B**, and **MedTech@Berkeley**, and published both scientific and public-facing writing in the *Berkeley Scientific Journal* and machine learning blogs.

Her current interests include:
- **NeuroAI and computational neuroscience**
- **Connectomics and theoretical neuroscience**
- **Molecular mechanisms of learning, pain, and psychiatric disease**
- **Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurotechnology**
- **Machine learning for biology and medicine**

As a first-gen aspiring researcher and female researcher in neurotech, Anisha is passionate about mentoring students from underrepresented backgrounds, particularly those navigating interdisciplinary research paths across biology, computation, and medicine.
